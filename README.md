Welcome to my GNSS Simulator app. Hopefully you find this to be a fun way to learn about Global Navigation Satellite Systems.

main.py contains all the code you need. Once you've installed the correct libraries, you will be able to use it entirely within the UI.

WASD keys navigate around the earth, space bar pauses/plays the orbital animation, and the mouse wheel zooms in/out.

You can toggle the satellites, the receiver, the orbital ellipses, the trilateration spheres and circles, and the lines of sight to the satellites. Note that the last few only make sense when there is a both receiver and a satellite. A slider controls the speed of the simulation.

The buttons are used to add satellites, view the status of current satellites, and alter the position of the receiver.

Happy navigating,

Adam
